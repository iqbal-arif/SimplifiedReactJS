1. EsLint sets rule for the app and points out any error that may occur and guides to fix it.
2. To bypass or change some rule;

   1. Go to **.eslintrc.cjs**
   2. Under **rules** add the rule with one of the values; "off", "warn", or "error".
      OR 0 for "off, 1 for warning, and 2 for error.

      ```
      rules: {
      "react/prop-types": "off",
      'react-refresh/only-export-components': [
      'warn',
      { allowConstantExport: true },
      ],
      },
      ```

```

```
